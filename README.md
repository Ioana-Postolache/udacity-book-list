# MyReads Project

After adding the dependencies (by running "npm  install"), the app can be launched by running "npm start".

In the main page ("/"), you can see 3 lists (shelves) of books, categorized as follows: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read". The books have the following details: title, authors and a thumbnail (where this type of data was available)
By right clicking on each book, you can see the shelf they are currently on and can change their shelf. You can even remove the book from the main page by moving it to "None".
When the browser is refreshed, the same information is displayed on the page.

By clicking on the "+" icon in the bottom right hand corner, you are taken to a new page ("/search") where you can search for books that fall in one of the following categories below:
'Android', 'Art', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astronomy', 'Austen', 'Baseball', 'Basketball', 'Bhagat', 'Biography', 'Brief', 'Business', 'Camus', 'Cervantes', 'Christie', 'Classics', 'Comics', 'Cook', 'Cricket', 'Cycling', 'Desai', 'Design', 'Development', 'Digital Marketing', 'Drama', 'Drawing', 'Dumas', 'Education', 'Everything', 'Fantasy', 'Film', 'Finance', 'First', 'Fitness', 'Football', 'Future', 'Games', 'Gandhi', 'Homer', 'Horror', 'Hugo', 'Ibsen', 'Journey', 'Kafka', 'King', 'Lahiri', 'Larsson', 'Learn', 'Literary Fiction', 'Make', 'Manage', 'Marquez', 'Money', 'Mystery', 'Negotiate', 'Painting', 'Philosophy', 'Photography', 'Poetry', 'Production', 'Programming', 'React', 'Redux', 'River', 'Robotics', 'Rowling', 'Satire', 'Science Fiction', 'Shakespeare', 'Singh', 'Swimming', 'Tale', 'Thrun', 'Time', 'Tolstoy', 'Travel', 'Ultimate', 'Virtual Reality', 'Web Development', 'iOS'

Any other terms that do not fall in the categories above will not return correct results. Search results are not shown when all of the text is deleted out of the search input box.
By right clicking on the books, you can see the shelf they are currently on and can move them to a new one, a change that you'll be able to see when moving to the main page.
